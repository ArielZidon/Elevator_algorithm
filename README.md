offline Algorithm:
This algorithm works in such a way that each elevator has an ascent list and a descent list so that from any pre-known reading we will embed the elevator with the shortest time to arrive considering the data of all the elevators in the requested building.
We will try to keep an elevator that goes up with appropriate readings going up until it stops on the top floor of the ascent list and then starts going down in the same way.
Each elevator has a calculation of the time it will take it to reach the next call based on the data it has (speed, opening and closing doors ..)
